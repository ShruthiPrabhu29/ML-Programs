This Repositiry contains workflow/demonstration of both Supervised and Unsupersied ML algorithms: it is demosntrated in jupyter notebook.
•	Supervised Algorithms:
1.	Simple Linear Regression, 
2.	Multiple Linear Regression, 
3.	Logistic Regression, 
4.	Naive Bay's Classifier.

•	Unsupervised Algorithm:
1.	K-Means Clustering

A beginner for ML can start with these simple programs. The corresponding dataset for each algorithm is also available.
Requirements : Install Anaconda (32bit/64bit), it comes with Jupyter Notebook. (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
